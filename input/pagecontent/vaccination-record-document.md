The **Vaccination Record document** describes the content and format of a vaccination record document. It is a compilation of all available immunization-related content and thus shows the patientâ€™s immunization status at a specific point in time. The vaccination dossier contains the entries from the vaccination documentation, i.e. information on applied immunizations and further relevant chapters as medical and exposition risks or serology results.

This document is allowed to be used in context of the Swiss EPR but can also be used in context of data exchange next to the Swiss EPR.

### FHIR document (Bundle)
This exchange format is defined as a document type that corresponds to a Bundle as a FHIR resource. 
A Bundle has a list of entries. The first entry is the Composition, in which all contained entries are then referenced.
