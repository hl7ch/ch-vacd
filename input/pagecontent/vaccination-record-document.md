The **Vaccination Record document** describes the content and format of a vaccination record document. It is a compilation of all available immunization-related content and thus shows the patientâ€™s immunization status at a specific point in time. The vaccination dossier contains the entries from the vaccination documentation, i.e. information on applied immunizations and further relevant chapters as medical and exposition risks or serology results.

This document is allowed to be used in context of the Swiss EPR but can also be used in context of data exchange next to the Swiss EPR.


### Aggregation
A vaccination record document can be an aggregation of multiple immunization administration documents.
The process of the aggregation and its criterias and problems is described [here](aggregator.html)


### FHIR document (Bundle)
This exchange format is defined as a document type that corresponds to a Bundle as a FHIR resource. 
A Bundle has a list of entries. The first entry is the Composition, in which all contained entries are then referenced.

### Identifiers

#### Identifier Format
In CH VACD it is specified to use an [UUID](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#uuid) as identifier, for both the document and resource identifiers.
For representing UUIDs the system needs to be urn:ietf:rfc:3986 as described here. The value has to start with urn:uuid:.

#### Document Identifier
Document identifier in [1.3 Vaccination Record](Bundle-1-3-VaccinationRecord.html):   
`Bundle.identifier`/`Composition.identifier`

``` json
  "identifier" : {
    "system" : "urn:ietf:rfc:3986",
    "value" : "urn:uuid:5bca53b2-0973-4b91-961e-b1e93474c9c2"
  }
```

### Narrative Text Generation
The narrative text in the composition of the bundle of type document can be generated using the FHIR XML representation and the defined xslt transformer defined in this implementation guide.
