### Duplicate Conflict

By aggregation of different [Immunization Administration](immunization-administration-document.html) documents, dupplicates could be detected. If so, the entries in the [Vaccination Record](vaccination-record-document.html) document (as result of the aggregation) should be completed with the extension [CH VACD Extension Merging Conflict Entry Reference](StructureDefinition-ch-vacd-ext-merging-conflict-entry-reference.html).
The criterias of duplicate detection can be found [here](StructureDefinition-ch-vacd-ext-merging-conflict-entry-reference.html#pastillness-medicalproblems-basicimmunization-condition).
