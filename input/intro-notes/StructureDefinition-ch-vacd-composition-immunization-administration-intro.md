### Scope and Usage

This composition is defined to use in an immunization administration context. This means to document and/or exchange one or more vaccination given/applied to a referenced patient.


This profile is inherited from the ch-core profile [CH Core Composition EPR](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7ch/ch-core/StructureDefinition-ch-core-composition-epr.html).
This restriction is done to have the required restrictions to use a corresponding document in the Swiss EPR within its restrictions. The same document can always be used 
in an other context than the Swiss EPR.
